# ![User Import](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/user_import/blob/1.x-3.x/images/user-import.png "User Import for BackdropCMS")

**Features include:**

* Creates an account for each user
* Match CSV columns to profile fields.
* Can optionally use the file's first row to map CSV data to user profile fields
* Option to create Usernames based on data from file, e.g. "John" + "Smith" => "JohnSmith"
* Usernames can be made of abbreviated data from file, e.g. "Jane" + "Doe" => "JDoe"
* Option to create random, human readable, usernames
* Option to import passwords or create random passwords for each user
* Can set user roles
* Option to send welcome email, with account details to each new user
* Can set each user's contact form to enabled
* Test mode option to check for errors
* Processing can be triggered by cron or manually by an administrator
* Can stagger number of users imported, so that not too many emails are sent at one time
* Multiple files can be imported/tested at the same time

* Designed to be massively scalable
